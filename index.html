                                    On our first semester of the Academic Year 2023-2024, we were tasked to create an Android Application in which we were to propose
                                    a feasible application that could be deployed. Just as our project last year, we were also divided into groups
                                    where each group contains five members. Our project application is an e-commerce app in which users would be able to purchase
                                    and even create a custom-made wearable beads. The application makes use of database for managing the products, and that the
                                    application makes use of the Kotlin programming language. I was tasked on programming some of the application's functionality and also
                                    for the database of the application.

                                    On our second semester of the the Academic Year 2022-2023, we were tasked to create a basic Java Game Application in which we were
                                    divided into groups where each group contains five members. Our project is a "Memory Game" in which users would have to press a series
                                    of buttons. The buttons contains numbers from 1 to 12. As the user progresses, each level becomes more and more difficult in which the
                                    user would have to remember more and more numbers. These numbers would first appear for the user to memorize, and if he presses the first 
                                    number, the rest of the numbers will disappear. It's up to the user then to recall which number should he press next.
